*************************************************************************

This program uses steganography standards to hide a file within a 
specified .mp3. And later, be able to retrieve that file in it's 
entirety. The file may be of any type as long as it is of a relatively 
smaller size than that of the .mp3 it will be hidden in. While it will 
work with any file format, this program was designed for the capacity 
of hiding documents, emails, and other textual data without the use of 
true encryption. It is important to understand that this program will 
not actually encrypt the file, it will only hide the file.

For further help on installing the Voices program please reference the 
INSTALL file.

For further help on using the program please use the "./voices" once 
installation is complete.
