*************************************************************************
Some portions of this program were taken from the ISO MPEG Audio Subgroup 
Software Simulation Group (1996) ISO 13818-3 MPEG-2 Audio Codec used for 
the MPEG audio decoding software. This decoding software is the software 
which Voices is based upon.

This Install file was taken from decoding software which Voices is based
upon; therefore these instructions will also work for the Voices
application.

Building Voices:

This version of Voices has been released open source with a binary.

For other systems you may have to modify the Makefile. Some flags of
interest are:

S_FORMAT
  Set to BINARY to work with most MPEG audio decoders (and save space). You
  can set it to ASCII, but your bitstream will only work with musicout().

HAVE_NINT
  Define this if your math library already has nint().

NDEBUG
  Define this to turn off all the assertions. Don't define this if you
  are developing code.

DEBUG
  Define this to get debugging messages printed to stdout.

For non-Unix systems you may have to define other things. Be sure to look
at common.h. If you build this on a Macintosh, be sure to use a fairly
recent set of Universal Headers.
